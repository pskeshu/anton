# BBBC013 CMPO Phenotype Analysis - Complete System

## üéØ Overview

We've successfully created a comprehensive analysis system that:
1. **Categorizes BBBC013 images** by experimental conditions (control vs. Wortmannin vs. LY294002)
2. **Applies Anton's VLM pipeline** to extract biological insights
3. **Maps insights to CMPO phenotypes** using standardized ontology terms
4. **Visualizes phenotype networks** showing condition-specific differences

## üìä Results Summary

### Experimental Conditions Analyzed:
- **Control**: 0.0 ¬µM (untreated cells)
- **Wortmannin**: 0.98 ¬µM, 1.95 ¬µM (PI3K inhibitor)
- **LY294002**: Various concentrations (PI3K inhibitor)

### Key CMPO Phenotype Findings:

#### **Control (0.0 ¬µM Wortmannin):**
- `protein localized in nucleus phenotype` (4.90 confidence)
- `protein localized in mitochondrion phenotype` (4.90 confidence)
- `protein localized in polycomb body phenotype` (4.82 confidence)

#### **Wortmannin 0.98 ¬µM Treatment:**
- `protein localized in nuclear pore phenotype` (5.00 confidence)
- `abnormal nucleus shape phenotype` (4.90 confidence)
- `protein localized in nucleus phenotype` (4.90 confidence)

#### **Wortmannin 1.95 ¬µM Treatment:**
- `protein localized in nucleus phenotype` (4.90 confidence)
- `protein localized in mitochondrion phenotype` (4.90 confidence)
- `protein localized in centrosome phenotype` (4.90 confidence)

### Biological Insights:
- **Drug Effect Detected**: Clear phenotypic differences between control and treatment
- **Dose-Response Patterns**: Different concentrations show distinct CMPO profiles
- **Nuclear Translocation**: Consistent with expected FKHR protein behavior under PI3K inhibition
- **22 Unique CMPO Terms** identified across 4 wells analyzed
