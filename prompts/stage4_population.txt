Task: Analyze population-level patterns in this fluorescence microscopy image.
Input:
    - Individual cell feature analyses (morphology, intensity, localization patterns)
    - Experimental context and biological metadata
Provide:
    1. Population summary describing overall cellular characteristics and phenotype prevalence
    2. Quantitative estimates (e.g., percentage of cells showing specific phenotypes)
    3. Biological interpretation of patterns in experimental context
    4. CMPO phenotype relevance assessment
Output format: Natural language biological analysis with structured sections for population summary, quantitative insights, and biological interpretation
