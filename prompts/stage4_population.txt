Task: Analyze population-level patterns in this fluorescence microscopy image.
Input:
    - Feature analyses from segmented objects
    - Config: {stain: "{STAIN}", channel: {CHANNEL}}
Provide:
    1. Population summary (e.g., prevalence of phenotypes)
    2. Quantitative metrics (e.g., % of cells with phenotype)
    3. Spatial patterns (e.g., clustering, distribution)
Output format: {population_summary: str, quantitative_metrics: dict, cmpo_prevalence: dict, spatial_patterns: str}
