Task: Analyze segmented regions for complex CMPO features, focusing on texture-based patterns.
Input:
    - Region patches: [nuclei, cytoplasm patches]
    - Config: {stain: "{STAIN}", channel: {CHANNEL}, phenotype_focus: "{PHENOTYPE}"}
    - Target features: ["chromatin_condensation", "LC3_puncta", "nuclear_fragmentation"]
Analyze:
    1. Texture patterns (granular, smooth, fragmented)
    2. Intensity distributions (bright spots, uniform, heterogeneous)
    3. Morphological features (shape irregularities, size variations)
Provide:
    1. Feature descriptions with confidence scores
    2. CMPO term mappings
    3. Supporting visual evidence
Output format: {features: [{name: str, confidence: float, evidence: str, cmpo_id: str}]}
